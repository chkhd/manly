Time to man up! Everybody knows the man pages are not for the faint of heart, but there are so many useful commands and handy options!

This repo is a log for my one-man-page-per-day challange. Basically I am going to do a full binary listing on FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris based distributions and read the man pages for one command per day, taking notes about interesting options and use cases.

May contain trace amounts of shell scripting.
