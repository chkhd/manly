Time to man up! Everybody knows the man pages are not for the faint of heart, but there are so many useful commands and handy options!

This repo is a log for my one-man-page-per-day challange. Basically I am going to do a full binary listing on FreeBSD, Linux and Solaris based distributions and read the man pages for every single command, one command per day, then I am going to take notes about interesting commands or their switches.

May contain trace amounts of shell scripting.
