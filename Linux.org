  watch [options] command

  execute a program periodically, showing output full-screen
  
  This command is very useful when monitoring some slow change or simply to emulate top.
  I usually run it with -d flag and -n set to one second.
  
  There are many places this command is useful, I sometimes use it to monitor VCS fail-overs and user activity.
