* watch(1)
  ~watch [options] command~

  Execute a program periodically, showing output full-screen

  This command is very useful when monitoring some slow change or simply to emulate top.
  I usually run it with ~-d~ flag and ~-n~ set to 1 (one second).

  There are many places this command is useful, I sometimes use it to monitor VCS fail-overs and user activity.

* from(1)
  ~from [-c] [-f file] [-s sender] [user]~

  Print names of those who have sent mail

  This can be used nicely in conjunction with wait to display incoming email.
  
  ~-s~ option can be used like a filter.
  
  MAIL environment variable is consulted for the mailbox location, otherwise default of /var/mail/user is used.
